## Usage

This repository is organized into separate branches, each covering a specific fundamental concept of NestJS. You can switch between branches to explore different features. To switch to a specific branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

For example, to explore the file uplaod use:

```bash
git checkout file-upload
```

Once you're on the desired branch, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the NestJS server, and you can access the API endpoints from your browser or API testing tool.

## Features

The repository covers the following fundamental concepts of NestJS:

- Validations: Examples of using validation decorators and DTOs for request payload validation.
- Decorators: Demonstrations of custom decorators and their usage in NestJS applications.
- Authentication with JWT: Implementation of JWT-based authentication and authorization using middleware.
- Session Management: Examples of implementing session-based authentication and managing user sessions.
- File Uploads: Illustrations of file uploading and handling using NestJS.
- Rate Limiting: Implementing rate limiting for API endpoints to control request frequency.
- Caching with MongoDB: Caching data from MongoDB using NestJS cache manager.

Feel free to explore each branch to learn more about these concepts and how they can be applied in NestJS applications.
